Run the bulk pricing-list recalculation across ALL listings in both Supabase projects:

- DEV: qzsmhgyojmwvtjmnrdea
- PROD: qcfifybkaddcoimjroca

Use the pricing-list Edge Function (`action: "create"`) for each listing.
Steps:
1) Use MCP to create snapshot tables in each project:
```
create table if not exists pricing_list_listing_backup_20260203 as
select _id as listing_id, pricing_list from listing;

create table if not exists pricing_list_backup_20260203 as
select pl.* from pricing_list pl join listing l on l.pricing_list = pl._id;
```
2) Run the bulk recalc using a local script or loop with rate limiting (3 concurrency, 150ms delay, 5 retries).
3) Verify with MCP queries (missing pricing_list, empty arrays, sample weekly/monthly).
4) Report total processed, failures, and verification counts.

Environment vars (already set in that session):
- SUPABASE_URL (per project)
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (per project)

Proceed dev first, then prod after dev verifies cleanly.
