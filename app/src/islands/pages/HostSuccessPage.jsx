Split Lease has been a game-changer, allowing me to rent out my space during these periods. The registration and listing process was straightforward, and the platform\'s flexibility is perfect for my needs, letting me rent out my apartment only on the nights I\'m away.',

Communication tools made coordinating with guests easy, and my first experience was seamless, with the guest leaving my apartment in great condition. Over the past six months, I\'ve hosted several guests, earning extra income that has helped me save for a vacation and cover unexpected expenses.',
