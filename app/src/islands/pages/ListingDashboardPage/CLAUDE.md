[COMPATIBILITY]: Returns both transformed properties and raw DB fields for EditListingDetails modal

### fetchLookupTables()
[INTENT]: Fetch all reference tables to resolve IDs to names/icons
[OUTPUT]: Object with amenities, safetyFeatures, houseRules, listingTypes, parkingOptions, storageOptions
[TABLES]: zat_features_amenity, zfut_safetyfeatures, zat_features_houserule, zat_features_listingtype, zat_features_parkingoptions, zat_features_storageoptions

## KEY_FEATURES

### Listing Table Support
[DESCRIPTION]: Uses listing table with '_id' (Bubble ID) as primary key
[FLOW]: Query listing table directly by '_id'
[PHOTOS]: Listings use listing_photo table for photo storage

### AI Import Assistant Workflow
[PHASE_1]: Load common data (in-unit amenities, building amenities, neighborhood description, house rules, safety features)

[PRICING]: Uses PricingEditSection full-screen overlay
[OTHER_SECTIONS]: Uses EditListingDetails modal (name, description, neighborhood, amenities, details, rules, availability, photos)
[SAVE_FLOW]: Modal saves to DB, calls handleSaveEdit to update local state, silently refreshes on close
