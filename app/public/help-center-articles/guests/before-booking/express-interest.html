                    <p><strong>Yes! Split Lease has an "I'm Interested" feature</strong> that lets you signal your interest to hosts without committing to a booking. This is perfect when you're exploring options and want hosts to know you're a potential guest.</p>

                            <p>Expressing interest is completely free and doesn't obligate you to book. Think of it like "favoriting" or "saving" a listing, but with the added benefit that the host sees your interest.</p>

                            <p>When you express interest, hosts receive a notification with your profile. This gives them a chance to reach out to you proactively, even if their calendar isn't perfectly aligned with your needs yet.</p>

                    <h2>When to Express Interest vs. Book Directly</h2>

                    <h3>✅ Express Interest When:</h3>

                    <p><strong>You're Still Exploring Options</strong><br>
                    You like the space but want to compare a few more listings before deciding.</p>

                    <p><strong>Your Timeline is Uncertain</strong><br>
                    You need a place eventually but don't have confirmed dates yet.</p>

                    <p><strong>You Have Questions First</strong><br>
                    You want to clarify details before committing to a booking request.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Schedule Doesn't Perfectly Match</strong><br>
                    You like the space but need different days than what's listed. The host might be flexible!</p>

                    <p><strong>You're Planning Ahead</strong><br>
                    You won't need the space for 2-3 months but want to signal your future interest.</p>

                    <p><strong>You Want to Test Responsiveness</strong><br>
                    See how quickly and thoroughly the host responds before making a booking request.</p>

                    <h3>⚡ Book Directly When:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You've found your perfect match and are ready to commit</li>
                        <li>Your schedule and the listing availability align</li>
                        <li>You've already messaged and gotten your questions answered</li>
                        <li>You want to secure the space before someone else does</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="info-box success">
                        <div class="info-box-icon"><i data-feather="zap"></i></div>
                        <div class="info-box-content">
                            <p><strong>Pro Strategy</strong></p>
                            <p>Express interest in 3-5 listings, then see which hosts respond enthusiastically. The most responsive, accommodating hosts often make the best long-term partners!</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <h2>What Happens After You Express Interest?</h2>

                    <h3>The Host May Reach Out</h3>
                    <p>Many hosts proactively message interested guests to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learn more about your schedule and needs</li>
                        <li>Offer additional information or photos</li>
                        <li>Discuss schedule flexibility</li>
                        <li>Invite you for a viewing or trial night</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>You Stay on Their Radar</h3>
                    <p>Even if the host doesn't immediately reach out:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They know you're interested if their schedule opens up</li>
                        <li>You'll be top-of-mind if another guest cancels</li>
                        <li>They may adjust their available days to accommodate you</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>You Can Follow Up Anytime</h3>
                    <p>Expressing interest opens the door for you to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Message the host when you're ready to book</li>
                        <li>Check in if your circumstances change</li>
                        <li>Ask questions at your own pace</li>
                    </ul>

                    Plant seeds for future bookings even if you're not ready today.</p>

                    <div class="info-box info">

                            <p><strong>Hosts Appreciate Interest</strong></p>
                            <p>Expressing interest is viewed positively by hosts. It shows you're serious about finding a Split Lease arrangement, even if you're not ready to book immediately. Many hosts prefer starting relationships this way!</p>

                    <h2>Moving from Interest to Booking</h2>

                    <p>Once you're ready to move forward:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Revisit your interested listings:</strong> Review your saved/favorited options</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrow down to top choice:</strong> Based on host responses and fit</li>
                        <li><strong>Ask final questions:</strong> Clarify any remaining concerns</li>
                        <li><strong>Propose a trial:</strong> Many hosts offer a trial night first</li>
                        <li><strong>Submit booking request:</strong> Move forward when you're confident</li>
                    </ol>

                            <p>Some hosts give priority to guests who expressed interest first, especially if they've been in communication. Building that relationship early can give you an advantage!</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Etiquette Tips</h2>

                    <p><strong>Don't Mass-Express Interest</strong><br>
                    It's fine to show interest in 3-5 listings, but expressing interest in 20+ without following up looks insincere.</p>

                    <p><strong>Respond if Hosts Reach Out</strong><br>
                    If a host messages you after you express interest, reply even if you're no longer interested.</p>

                    <p><strong>Update Hosts When Your Plans Change</strong><br>
                    If you book elsewhere or your needs change, let interested hosts know so they can move on.</p>

                    <p><strong>Be Genuine</strong><br>
                    Only express interest in places you're actually considering. Hosts invest time in responding.</p>
