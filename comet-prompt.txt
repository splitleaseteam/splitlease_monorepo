I need to verify the exact pricing calculation formulas in the Bubble backend. Please examine the relevant workflows and answer these specific questions:

## QUESTION 1: Discounts and Markups Multiplier Formula

In the pricing workflows (likely in "Price Calculations" folder or "core-save_pricing_robert"), find where the "Discounts and Markups Multiplier" is calculated.

**What I need to know:**
- Is the formula ADDITIVE: `1 + markup - discount`
- Or MULTIPLICATIVE: `(1 + markup) * (1 - discount)`

Looking at the z-pricing-unit-test page, the multiplier shows:
- 1.17 for 2-6 nights (17% markup, no discount)
- 1.04 for 7 nights (should be 17% markup minus 13% full-time discount)

If additive: 1 + 0.17 - 0.13 = 1.04
If multiplicative: 1.17 * 0.87 = 1.0179

**Please confirm which formula is used and show me the exact Bubble expression.**

## QUESTION 2: Nightly vs Monthly/Weekly Calculation

Are the pricing calculations DIFFERENT for Nightly rental type vs Monthly/Weekly?

Specifically:
- Does Nightly rental type use the same multiplier formula?
- Or does Nightly apply markup AFTER subtracting the discount (which would be mathematically different)?

**Please show me the workflow/expression for Nightly rental type price calculation.**

---

## QUESTION 3: Unit Markup Application

Is "Unit Markup" (the listing-specific markup from Unit Markup field) applied to ALL rental types?

- Monthly: Is unitMarkup included?
- Weekly: Is unitMarkup included?
- Nightly: Is unitMarkup included?

**Please confirm by showing the expressions that include/exclude unitMarkup.**

## QUESTION 4: Unused Nights Discount Formula

How is the "Unused Nights Discount" calculated? I see three possible formulas:

A) LINEAR: `unusedNights * 0.03` (where 0.03 is the multiplier from ZAT config)
B) PROPORTIONAL: `baseDiscount * (unusedNights / 6)`
C) LOOKUP TABLE: Fixed values per unused night count (1 night = 0.05, 2 nights = 0.07, etc.)

**Please show me the exact formula/expression used.**

---

## QUESTION 5: Full-Time Discount

Confirm the Full-Time Discount:
- Is it 13% (0.13)?
- Does it ONLY apply to 7-night stays?
- Is it applied BEFORE or AFTER the markup?

---

## QUESTION 6: Price List Array Generation

In the "run_price_list" or similar workflow that generates the pricing arrays, please show me:

1. How "Host Compensation" array is populated (7 elements for 1-7 nights)
2. How "Nightly Price" array is calculated from Host Compensation
3. The exact formula that produces the "Markup and Discounts Multiplier" array

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

For each question, please provide:
1. The workflow/page name where you found the answer
2. The exact Bubble expression or formula
3. A simple "yes/no" or value confirmation

Example:
```
Q1: Multiplier Formula
- Location: Workflow "calculate_pricing_multiplier" Step 3
- Expression: 1 + This Listing's Site Markup + This Listing's Unit Markup - Unused Nights Discount - Full Time Discount
- Answer: ADDITIVE formula confirmed
```

This will help us align our React frontend and Supabase backend with the Bubble source of truth.
