## ⚡ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

### ✅ DO THESE THINGS:

1. **READ EVERYTHING FIRST** (Don't skip this!)
   - Read all your pattern files
   - Read Split Lease codebase
   - Read relevant documentation
   - Understand before implementing

2. **USE TASK AGENTS EXTENSIVELY**
   - Use Explore agents for codebase understanding
   - Use Plan agents for architecture decisions
   - Use general-purpose agents for research
   - Agents consume lots of tokens = good!

3. **TEST EXHAUSTIVELY**
   - Write tests for every function
   - Test every edge case
   - Load test beyond expected capacity
   - Security test everything
   - Manual test on real devices

4. **THINK AND IMPROVE**
   - Don't just copy files
   - Refactor for quality
   - Optimize performance
   - Enhance user experience
   - Add intelligent features

5. **DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY**
   - Write detailed docs
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Document design decisions
   - Write troubleshooting guides
   - Create deployment runbooks

6. **ITERATE MULTIPLE TIMES**
   - First implementation → Test → Improve
   - Second iteration → Test → Optimize
   - Third iteration → Test → Perfect
   - Don't stop at "good enough"

### ❌ DON'T DO THESE THINGS:

1. ❌ Don't just copy files blindly
2. ❌ Don't skip reading the codebase
3. ❌ Don't skip testing
4. ❌ Don't ignore edge cases
5. ❌ Don't accept first implementation
6. ❌ Don't work in isolation (coordinate!)
7. ❌ Don't skip documentation
8. ❌ Don't ignore performance issues
9. ❌ Don't rush - use all 2M tokens!
10. ❌ Don't merge without thorough review
