  "prompt": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - Continue Phase B execution of Run 009 for Split Lease's AI Design Team (10 agents producing 28 deliverables)\n   - Monitor completion of all agent deliverables\n   - After completion, user raised concern that source materials are outdated (usability tests from Aug 2025, customer calls from years ago)\n   - User explicitly requested \"option 1\" - Codebase Audit to verify which bugs from agent reports still exist in current code\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Orchestrator pattern coordinating 10 specialized design agents\n   - Two-phase workflow: Phase A (brainstorm) → Phase B (execution with 28 deliverables)\n   - Wave-based dependency management (Wave 1: Foundation, Wave 2: Flows, Wave 3: Deliverables)\n   - Background subagent execution with parallel Task tool calls\n   - Codebase validation using Grep to verify bug existence\n   - 10 Agent domains: Paula Scher (Host Acquisition), Saul Bass (Landing/Hero), Massimo Vignelli (Search/Listings), Dieter Rams (Trust), Don Norman (Proposal Flows), Jony Ive (Mobile), Josef M-B (Design System), Charles Eames (Onboarding), Milton Glaser (Copy), Luke Wroblewski (Conversion)\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `runs/run-009--2026-02-03/_manifest.md`\n     - Central tracking document for Run 009\n     - Updated to mark Phase B COMPLETE with all 28/28 deliverables\n     - Updated timeline showing all waves complete\n   \n   - `runs/run-009--2026-02-03/deliverables/` (28 files created)\n     - All deliverables produced by 10 agents including specs, wireframes, HTML mockups\n     - Key P0 files: `quick-win-checklist.md`, `copy-bug-fixes.md`, `p0-bug-fix-spec.md`\n   \n   - `app/src/islands/shared/SignUpLoginModal.jsx:1715-1729`\n     - Contains the FIXED copy: \"I'm new around here\" (not the buggy \"I'm here around here\")\n     - Confirms Bug G-01 from agent report is already fixed\n   \n   - Codebase Audit Search Results:\n     - \"here around here\" → NOT FOUND (already fixed)\n     - \"2:0 pm\" → NOT FOUND (already fixed)\n     - \"No, this description\" → NOT FOUND (already fixed)\n     - \"jpg, png, now:\" → NOT FOUND (already fixed)\n     - \"***\" pattern → Found only in legitimate uses (SSN/email masking in `formatLeaseDisplay.js`)\n     - Time formatting utilities exist in 25+ files\n     - Empty state components exist in 134 files\n     - Trust/verification patterns in 372 files\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - No code errors encountered\n   - User feedback: User pointed out that source materials are stale (usability tests 6 months old, customer calls years old) and agents produced deliverables based on potentially already-fixed issues\n   - Fix approach: User requested Option 1 (Codebase Audit) to validate which issues still exist before implementing any fixes\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully monitored and confirmed completion of all 28 Phase B deliverables\n   - Updated manifest with completion status\n   - Sent Slack notification about Run 009 completion\n   - Began codebase audit to verify which reported bugs still exist in current code\n   - Initial audit findings show several bugs are already fixed (\"I'm here around here\", time formatting, description grammar)\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"do not compact, i think there are many things mentioned on this reposts that was already fixed, the usablity tests where a couple of months ago and the customer calls years ago when we were validating the model, i few that the agents dont have a clear vision of the site how they can have that just analisng the code base or runnning a comet validations\"\n   - \"option 1\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete the codebase audit to verify all 13 copy bugs from Milton's report\n   - Produce a filtered list showing which issues are \"VERIFIED STILL BROKEN\" vs \"ALREADY FIXED\"\n   - Continue searching for remaining issues mentioned in agent deliverables\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Running codebase audit (Option 1) to verify which bugs from agent reports still exist. Currently searched for:\n   - Copy bugs (typos, grammar issues) - mostly NOT FOUND (already fixed)\n   - \"What is Split Lease\" content - EXISTS in help center\n   - Empty state components - EXIST (134 files)\n   - Trust/verification/badge patterns - EXIST (372 files)\n   - Monthly estimate pricing - EXISTS in help articles and pages\n   \n   Was in the middle of verifying additional issues when summary was requested.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue the codebase audit to verify remaining bugs from the agent reports. User explicitly said \"option 1\" to verify which bugs still exist in the codebase. The audit should:\n   - Check remaining copy bugs from the 13 identified in `copy-bug-fixes.md`\n   - Search for other issues mentioned across the 28 deliverables\n   - Produce a final report showing which items need action vs which are already resolved\n   \n   Quote from user: \"option 1\" (referring to \"Option 1: Codebase Audit - Have agents scan the actual codebase to verify which bugs still exist\")\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\.claude\\projects\\c--Users-Split-Lease-Documents-Split-Lease\\e447cfea-0e77-4f42-a03d-2d8d6d7183c5.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.",
