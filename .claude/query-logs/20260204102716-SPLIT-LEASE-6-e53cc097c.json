  "prompt": "The intention of the above commit was to introduce more accurate verbose logging to the cases where the error was the incomplete lease documents, but the fix broke the previously working functionality of terrence grey, and the logs and alerts for http://localhost:3001/_manage-leases-payment-records/1770078129594x21738759722852084 and http://localhost:3001/_manage-leases-payment-records/1770142068205x47801772330305936\n Switch back to the try, fix, test repeat using playwright to proceed",
  "summary": "*Intention*: Identify the regression in the lease readiness modal implementation\n*Implementation*: Used Playwright to test both terrence grey and luis suarez leases - readiness modal displays correctly for both\n*Next*: Awaiting user clarification on what specific behavior is broken",
  "complete": "The screenshot shows the **\"Generate Documents\"** button (purple button in Document Management section) triggers the readiness modal.\n\n**What's working:**\n- Modal opens showing \"All 4 documents are ready to generate\"\n- Each document shows its readiness status with ✓ checkmarks\n- Optional missing data is listed (not blocking)\n- \"Generate (4)\" button is enabled\n\nThe readiness check system appears to be functioning correctly for this terrence grey lease. \n\n**To clarify:** What specific behavior did you expect that isn't happening? Is it:\n\n1. **Document content issues** - Images still showing as `{%image1}` tags in the actual generated documents?\n2. **Different logging output** - Expected more verbose console logs?\n3. **Different modal behavior** - Expected something different in the modal UI?\n4. **A different lease** - The issue occurs with a different lease, not terrence grey?\n\nPlease let me know what you're seeing that's unexpected so I can focus on the right area.\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Identify the regression in the lease readiness modal implementation\n*Implementation*: Used Playwright to test both terrence grey and luis suarez leases - readiness modal displays correctly for both\n*Next*: Awaiting user clarification on what specific behavior is broken"
