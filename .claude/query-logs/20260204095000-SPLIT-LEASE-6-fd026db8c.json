Better messages + validation before committing.\n**For commit message generation, which approach do you prefer?**\n1. **AST-based analysis** - Parse the actual diff, detect function additions/modifications/deletions, extract semantic meaning from code structure (e.g., \"add `validateBooking` function to `BookingForm.jsx`\")\n2. **LLM-powered** - Send the diff to an LLM (via edge function or local) to generate a human-quality commit message (e.g., \"feat(booking): add client-side validation for date range overlaps\")\n3. **Template + heuristics** - Enhanced pattern matching on diffs (detect added exports, new files, renamed functions) without external dependencies - faster but less intelligent\n**Trade-offs:**\n| Approach | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|------|------|\n| AST-based | Accurate, no external calls, deterministic | Complex to implement, language-specific parsers needed |\n| LLM-powered | Best quality messages, understands intent | Adds latency, requires API call, costs money |\n| Template + heuristics | Fast, no dependencies, predictable | Less intelligent, may miss nuance |\nMy recommendation: **LLM-powered** - You already have `ai-gateway` edge function, and commit messages benefit most from understanding *intent* not just *structure*. A 1-2 second delay at session end is acceptable.\nWhich approach?",
