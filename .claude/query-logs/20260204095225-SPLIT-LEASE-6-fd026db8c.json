Can you investigate why this behavior happened. Another thing I noticed was that the type of space includes a unique Id instead of actual data. and the space details includes a decimal when the decimal to the right is a zero",
  "summary": "*Intention*: Fix three document rendering issues - images as tags, Bubble IDs in Type of Space, and decimal formatting for bathrooms\n*Implementation*: Fixed image tag syntax to `{{%image1}}`, added Bubble ID detection in buildTypeOfSpace, and conditional decimal formatting for bathrooms\n*Changes*: `supabase/functions/lease-documents/lib/templateRenderer.ts`, `app/src/logic/processors/documents/buildDocumentPayload.js`\n*Next*: User to visually verify generated documents show actual images and correct formatting",
  "complete": "All 4 documents generated successfully. The fixes appear to be working in the payload:\n\n1. **Type of Space**: Now shows `\"2 guest(s) max\"` instead of Bubble ID\n2. **Bathrooms**: Shows `\"1 bathroom(s)\"` instead of `\"1.0 bathroom(s)\"`  \n3. **Images**: Passed correctly with no errors\n\nPlease verify by opening the **Supplemental Agreement** document:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1xbLJiUDFWDODxiGRoKGSTFuiXSS_wFEf/edit\n\nCheck if:\n1. Images now render as actual pictures (not `{{%image1}}` tags or base64 strings)\n2. Type of Space no longer shows the Bubble ID\n3. Bathrooms shows \"1\" instead of \"1.0\"\n\nLet me know what you see and if any issues remain.\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Fix three document rendering issues - images as tags, Bubble IDs in Type of Space, and decimal formatting for bathrooms\n*Implementation*: Fixed image tag syntax to `{{%image1}}`, added Bubble ID detection in buildTypeOfSpace, and conditional decimal formatting for bathrooms\n*Changes*: `supabase/functions/lease-documents/lib/templateRenderer.ts`, `app/src/logic/processors/documents/buildDocumentPayload.js`\n*Next*: User to visually verify generated documents show actual images and correct formatting"
