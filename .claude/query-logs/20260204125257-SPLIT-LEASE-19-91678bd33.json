  "prompt": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - User identifies as an \"agent orchestrator\" managing a system of 10 AI design agents named after famous designers\n   - User shared a conversation with Igor (boss) about improving long-running AI agent processes\n   - User requested review of all 10 agent configurations, memories, and prompts to suggest improvements for next runs\n   - User proposed a \"go get it\" approach where agents use Playwright to capture screenshots themselves\n   - User wants to TEST the new approach by redesigning the **host-overview page** at `https://split.lease/host-overview` using all 10 agents in a new run\n   - Test credentials provided: Host: `rodtesthost@test.com` / Password: `eCom@2024`\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - 10-agent design system with specialized domains (Paula Scher=Host Acquisition, Saul Bass=Landing/Hero, Massimo Vignelli=Search/Listings, Don Norman=Proposal Flows, Dieter Rams=Trust, Jony Ive=Mobile, Josef M-B=Design System, Charles Eames=Onboarding, Milton Glaser=Messaging, Luke Wroblewski=Conversion)\n   - Run-based orchestration (runs/run-XXX--YYYY-MM-DD/ folder structure)\n   - Phase A (Brainstorm) → Phase B (Execute) workflow\n   - Igor's framework: 2-4+ hour runtime, ≤1 human touchpoint per 2 hours, total tokens used optimization\n   - Journey-based context capture (vs static code analysis)\n   - Books as goals (feeding book chapters as prompts)\n   - Playwright MCP for browser automation and screenshot capture\n   - Current site state verification before brainstorming (Phase 0 concept)\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `agents/orchestrator/agent.md` - Orchestrator identity, run management, prompt writing format\n   - `agents/orchestrator/memory.md` - Run history (Run 001-009), patterns learned\n   - All 10 agent folders read: `agent.md`, `memory.md`, `prompt.md` for Paula Scher, Saul Bass, Massimo Vignelli, Don Norman, Dieter Rams, Jony Ive, Josef M-B, Charles Eames, Milton Glaser, Luke Wroblewski\n   - Key finding from agent memories: Run 009 Phase B completed with deliverables for all agents\n   - Agent-Specific Gaps identified:\n     ```\n     Paula Scher: Host CTA broken (Run 003) but not re-verified\n     Saul Bass: Hero variants created without seeing current hero\n     Massimo Vignelli: Schedule visibility spec without current search behavior\n     Don Norman: 17-state machine without code verification\n     Dieter Rams: Trust audit status unclear post-Run 003\n     Jony Ive: Touch target audit at 20% compliance, no re-measurement\n     Josef M-B: FormInput spec not compared to existing components\n     Charles Eames: Empty states designed without seeing current ones\n     Milton Glaser: Copy bugs cataloged without shipped verification\n     Luke Wroblewski: A/B tests specified without baseline metrics\n     ```\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Error**: Navigated to `https://split.lease/login` → Got 404 Page Not Found\n     - Fix: Tried app.split.lease subdomain instead\n   - **Error**: Logged into `https://app.split.lease/signup-login` with credentials → Got \"We couldn't find rodtesthost@test.com\"\n     - User feedback: \"sorry wrong site, the correct site is split.lease not app.split.lease\"\n     - Fix: Navigated to correct site `https://split.lease`\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Identified core problem from Igor conversation: \"Agents suggest fixes for things already fixed because they don't know current site state\"\n   - Proposed solution: Phase 0 self-capture using Playwright before analysis\n   - Designed agent-specific capture tasks with login flows for authenticated pages\n   - Created capture protocol with test credentials for Host and Guest views\n   - Currently troubleshooting login flow to access host-overview page\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"you are an agent orchestrador\"\n   - [Shared path to orchestrator agent.md]\n   - [Shared Igor conversation transcript - long transcript about long-running processes, inputs, goals, false positives problem]\n   - \"read the context of each agent and memory and suggest improments for the neext runs\"\n   - \"by reading this [Agent gaps table]... i few that maybe we should create a go get it aproach where the agents use playright to capture those images, accessing split.lease, some pages that need login they can use test accounts host - rodtesthost@test.com guest - splitleasetesting@test.com password: eCom@2024 for both\"\n   - \"ok can we do a test, i want to redesign the host-overview page you can acess it by login wiht this host - rodtesthost@test.com password: eCom@2024 the url is https://split.lease/host-overview suggest an aproach to use all agents, is it possible to test that on a another run\"\n   - \"sorry wrong site, teh currect site is split.lease not app.split lease\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete login to split.lease as host (rodtesthost@test.com)\n   - Navigate to and capture host-overview page\n   - Propose Run 010 structure for redesigning host-overview page using all 10 agents\n   - Design how each agent would contribute to the host-overview redesign\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Testing the Playwright-based capture approach to access the host-overview page at split.lease. Just successfully navigated to `https://split.lease` homepage. The page loaded correctly showing the Split Lease homepage with navigation, hero section, listings, and footer. Need to find the Sign In link and login as host to access the host-overview page.\n\n   User's exact request: \"ok can we do a test, i want to redesign the host-overview page you can acess it by login wiht this host - rodtesthost@test.com password: eCom@2024 the url is https://split.lease/host-overview suggest an aproach to use all agents, is it possible to test that on a another run\"\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Click the \"Sign In\" link (ref=e23) on the split.lease homepage to access the login modal, then login with credentials `rodtesthost@test.com` / `eCom@2024`, then navigate to `/host-overview` to capture the current state and propose a Run 010 structure for the redesign using all 10 agents.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\.claude\\projects\\c--Users-Split-Lease-Documents-Split-Lease\\25ce023f-af51-4f9f-98ee-854be0e1bc28.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.",

  "complete": "## Run 010 Proposal: Host Overview Redesign with Self-Capture\n\nI successfully tested the Playwright-based approach and captured the current state of the host-overview page. Here's the proposal:\n\n### Self-Capture Test Results\n\n**Login flow worked:** The Playwright automation successfully:\n1. Navigated to split.lease\n2. Clicked \"Sign In\"\n3. Filled credentials (`rodtesthost@test.com` / `eCom@2024`)\n4. Logged in as \"Rod\"\n5. Navigated to `/host-overview`\n6. Captured full-page screenshot\n\n### Current Page State Identified\n\nThe host-overview page contains:\n- **Welcome header** — \"Welcome back, Rod\" with dismissible help banner\n- **Action bar** — \"+ Create New Listing\" and \"Import Listing\" buttons\n- **Listings grid** — 4 listing cards with thumbnails, titles, locations\n- **Card actions** — Manage/Preview buttons, Proposals/Leases/House Manual badges\n- **House Manuals section** — Empty state\n\n**Issues observed:**\n- Some listing thumbnails missing (placeholder shown)\n- \"Location not specified\" for some listings\n- Inconsistent badge styling\n- Empty state copy could be more actionable\n\n### Run 010 Structure (Three Phases)\n\n| Phase | Description | Output |\n|-------|-------------|--------|\n| **Phase 0** | Each agent self-captures screenshots via Playwright | `screenshots/[agent]-*.png` |\n| **Phase A** | Brainstorm through domain lens using their own captures | `brainstorm/[agent]-brainstorm.md` |\n| **Phase B** | Concrete deliverables (specs, wireframes, copy) | `deliverables/[agent]-deliverable.*` |\n\n### Agent Assignments by Priority\n\n| Priority | Agent | Focus Area |\n|----------|-------|------------|\n| CRITICAL | **Massimo Vignelli** | Listing cards grid, information architecture |\n| CRITICAL | **Jony Ive** | Mobile viewport, responsive breakpoints |\n| HIGH | Paula Scher | Dashboard hierarchy, host journey |\n| HIGH | Saul Bass | Welcome banner, visual hooks |\n| HIGH | Don Norman | Card interactions, flow to proposals/leases |\n| HIGH | Dieter Rams | Trust badges, verification indicators |\n| HIGH | Josef M-B | Component tokens, spacing consistency |\n| HIGH | Charles Eames | Empty states, help banner, onboarding |\n| HIGH | Milton Glaser | All UI text, CTA labels, voice |\n| FINAL | **Luke Wroblewski** | Conversion analysis, A/B test proposals |\n\n### Files Created\n\n- [_manifest.md](runs/run-010--2026-02-04/_manifest.md) — Full run specification\n- [orchestrator-baseline-capture.png](runs/run-010--2026-02-04/screenshots/orchestrator-baseline-capture.png) — Baseline screenshot\n\n### Ready to Execute\n\nThe \"go get it\" approach is validated. Each agent can now:\n1. Use Playwright to login and capture their own domain-specific screenshots\n2. Analyze current state rather than making assumptions\n3. Produce deliverables based on real observations\n\nDo you want me to write the Phase 0 prompts for all 10 agents to launch this run?\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Test self-capture approach and propose Run 010 for host-overview redesign\n*Implementation*: Successfully logged into split.lease via Playwright, captured host-overview page, created Run 010 manifest with 10-agent assignments across 3 phases\n*Changes*: `runs/run-010--2026-02-04/_manifest.md`, `runs/run-010--2026-02-04/screenshots/orchestrator-baseline-capture.png`, updated `orchestrator/memory.md`\n*Next*: Awaiting approval to write Phase 0 prompts for all 10 agents"
