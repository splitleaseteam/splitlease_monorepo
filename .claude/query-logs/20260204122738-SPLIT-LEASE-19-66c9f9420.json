  "complete": "Based on my comprehensive review of all 10 agents, their memories, and Igor's feedback, here are my recommendations:\n\n---\n\n# Design Agent System: Improvement Recommendations\n\n## Critical Problem Identified by Igor\n\n**\"Agents suggest fixes for things already fixed because they don't know the current state of the site.\"**\n\nThe agents are analyzing code and documentation, but have no visual context of what the site actually looks like today.\n\n---\n\n## Current System Strengths\n\n| Strength | Evidence |\n|----------|----------|\n| Rich specialization | 10 distinct domains with clear ownership |\n| Accumulated knowledge | 9 runs of institutional memory |\n| Cross-agent collaboration | Dependency chains, synthesis reports |\n| Book-informed design | Run 005 summaries integrated |\n| Deliverable quality | Run 009 produced production-ready specs |\n\n---\n\n## Key Issues to Address\n\n### 1. **Missing Journey Context**\nAgents analyze usability tests as documents, not replayed experiences.\n\n**Current State:**\n- Usability test reports analyzed as text\n- No video/visual context of current site\n- Recommendations may duplicate already-shipped fixes\n\n**Igor's Solution:**\n```\n1. Extract JOURNEY from usability test (not just page descriptions)\n2. Have Comet replicate journey on CURRENT site\n3. Record as Loom\n4. Now agents have context of what site looks like TODAY\n5. Ask: \"What did users love before that's missing now?\"\n```\n\n### 2. **Books as Goals (Not Just Context)**\nRun 005 created book summaries, but books aren't generating goals yet.\n\n**Igor's Suggestion:**\n- Use book chapters as prompts\n- \"Platform Revolution Chapter 5\" → generates goals → agents use those goals\n- Change book input daily for variety\n\n### 3. **False Positive Reduction**\nAgents brainstorm freely but produce some irrelevant suggestions.\n\n**Root Cause:** No current-state verification before ideation\n\n**Solution:** Add \"Current State Check\" phase:\n```\nPhase 0: VERIFY\n- Comet walks current site\n- Records journey matching usability test\n- Creates \"current-site-state.md\"\n\nPhase A: BRAINSTORM (with current state context)\nPhase B: EXECUTE (with verified gaps only)\n```\n\n### 4. **Human Touchpoint Reduction**\nIgor's goal: **≤1 human intervention per 2 hours**\n\n**Current State:** Rod triggers each agent manually\n\n**Improvements:**\n- Soft notifications when agents complete (Slack/webhook)\n- Batch agent execution (all 10 run in parallel)\n- No \"waiting for Rod\" checkpoints during Phase A/B\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Changes for Next Runs\n\n### Run 010 Structure\n\n```\nRUN-010: Journey-Based Improvement Cycle\n\nINPUTS:\n├── Current Site Loom Recordings (NEW)\n│   ├── Guest: Search → Detail → Proposal journey\n│   ├── Host: Signup → Listing → Dashboard journey\n│   └── Both: Key happy paths recorded\n│\n├── Usability Test Journeys (Extracted)\n│   ├── What user tried to do (step-by-step)\n│   └── Where friction occurred\n│\n├── One Book Chapter (Rotating Daily)\n│   └── Day 1: Platform Revolution Ch.5\n│   └── Day 2: Hooked Ch.3\n│   └── Day 3: Don't Make Me Think Ch.1\n│\n└── Previous Run Memory (Run 009 deliverables)\n\nPHASE 0: CURRENT STATE CAPTURE (Comet/Loom)\n- 30-60 minutes\n- Human: Start recording\n- Output: Journey videos + screenshots\n\nPHASE A: GAP ANALYSIS (All Agents)\n- Compare usability test journey → current site journey\n- Identify: \"What's still broken?\"\n- Eliminate: \"What's already fixed?\"\n- Focus: Verified gaps only\n\nPHASE B: EXECUTE (Deliverables)\n- Only work on verified gaps\n- No speculative recommendations\n```\n\n### New Prompt Template\n\n```markdown\n# Task: Gap Analysis — [Agent Domain]\nDate: YYYY-MM-DD\nRun: run-010--YYYY-MM-DD\nBook Goal: [Chapter title + key principle]\n\n## Context Materials\n1. **Current Site Recording**: [link to Loom]\n2. **Usability Test Journey**: [extracted steps]\n3. **Your Run 009 Deliverables**: [list of what you already produced]\n\n## Your Task\n1. Watch current site recording\n2. Compare to usability test observations\n3. Identify ONLY issues that still exist\n4. Mark items from Run 009 as: SHIPPED / STILL-OPEN / OBSOLETE\n\n## Constraint\nDo NOT recommend anything that:\n- Is already shipped (verify in recording)\n- Was addressed in a previous run\n- Cannot be verified as still broken\n\n## Output\nSave to: runs/run-010--YYYY-MM-DD/gap-analysis/[agent-name].md\n```\n\n---\n\n## Agent-Specific Improvements\n\n| Agent | Current Gap | Recommended Fix |\n|-------|-------------|-----------------|\n| **Paula Scher** | Host page CTA verified as broken (Run 003) but not re-verified | Add \"verification step\" to Phase B prompts |\n| **Saul Bass** | Hero variants created without seeing current hero | Provide current hero screenshot/recording |\n| **Massimo Vignelli** | Schedule visibility spec created, but current search behavior unknown | Comet screenshot current search page first |\n| **Don Norman** | State machine documented 17 states without verifying current implementation | Cross-reference code with state spec |\n| **Dieter Rams** | Trust audit found unverified claims; status unclear post-Run 003 | Re-audit with Comet to check if claims removed |\n| **Jony Ive** | Touch target audit at 20% compliance; no re-measurement | Automated touch target scan script |\n| **Josef M-B** | FormInput spec complete but not compared to existing components | Code audit for existing implementations |\n| **Charles Eames** | Empty states designed without seeing current empty states | Screenshot current empty states first |\n| **Milton Glaser** | Copy bugs cataloged but no verification of which are shipped | Check codebase for bug fix status |\n| **Luke Wroblewski** | A/B tests specified but no baseline metrics exist | Instrumentation is prerequisite |\n\n---\n\n## New Workflow: Daily Input Rotation\n\nPer Igor's framework, create one new process per day by rotating inputs:\n\n| Day | Book Input | Video Input | Focus Area |\n|-----|------------|-------------|------------|\n| Mon | Platform Revolution Ch.5 | Guest proposal journey | Marketplace dynamics |\n| Tue | Don't Make Me Think Ch.1-3 | Host onboarding journey | Cognitive load |\n| Wed | Hooked Ch.1-4 | Search → favorite journey | Habit formation |\n| Thu | Influence Ch.2-4 | Trust pages journey | Persuasion |\n| Fri | Web Form Design Ch.1-5 | Form completion journey | Conversion |\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\n### Immediate (Before Run 010)\n- [ ] Record 3 Loom videos of current site journeys (Guest, Host, Key flows)\n- [ ] Extract step-by-step journey from Amanda's usability test\n- [ ] Select first book chapter for goal generation\n- [ ] Create `current-site-state.md` with screenshots\n\n### Run 010 Structure\n- [ ] Add Phase 0 (Current State Capture) to orchestrator workflow\n- [ ] Update all 10 agent prompts with gap-analysis template\n- [ ] Add \"SHIPPED / STILL-OPEN / OBSOLETE\" tracking to memory files\n- [ ] Configure soft notifications for agent completion\n\n### Post-Run 010\n- [ ] Review false positive rate (did gap analysis reduce noise?)\n- [ ] Measure human touchpoints (did we achieve ≤1 per 2 hours?)\n- [ ] Document which book-as-goal approach worked best\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nIgor's key insight: **\"We can improve false positives by creating outputs that act as inputs.\"**\n\nThe current system produces good ideas but lacks verification. By adding:\n1. **Journey recordings** of current site\n2. **Gap analysis** comparing usability tests to current state\n3. **Book-driven goals** (not just book-context)\n4. **Daily input rotation** for fresh perspectives\n\n...the agents will produce more actionable, verified recommendations with fewer false positives.\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Review all agents and suggest improvements based on Igor conversation\n*Implementation*: Read all 10 agent configs, memories, prompts; analyzed against Igor's framework\n*Next*: Create Run 010 with journey-based context, gap analysis phase, and book-as-goals approach"
