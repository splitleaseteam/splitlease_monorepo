  "prompt": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze this conversation:\n\n1. Initial Setup: User established orchestrator role for Split Lease's AI Design Team with 10 agents\n2. Run 009 was created for overnight analysis of usability tests + 68 customer call transcripts\n3. Phase A (brainstorm) completed - all 10 agents produced brainstorm files\n4. User requested synthesis and concrete deliverable assignments\n5. I read all 10 brainstorm files, created synthesis report, and wrote Phase B prompts\n6. User said \"next\" - I launched all 10 agents in parallel background mode for Phase B execution\n7. All 10 agents are currently running in background producing 28 deliverables\n\nKey files involved:\n- 10 brainstorm files (all read)\n- synthesis.md (created)\n- _manifest.md (updated)\n- 10 prompt.md files (all updated with Phase B assignments)\n- 10 background agents launched\n\nTechnical patterns:\n- Orchestrator pattern coordinating 10 specialized design agents\n- Two-phase workflow: Phase A (brainstorm) → Phase B (execution)\n- Background subagent execution with Task tool\n- Wave-based dependency management (3 waves)\n\nCurrent state: All 10 agents running in background, producing deliverables to runs/run-009--2026-02-03/deliverables/\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user established me as the **Orchestrator Agent** for Split Lease's AI Design Team (10 agents). The requests were:\n   - Create Run 009 for overnight analysis of usability tests + 68 customer call transcripts\n   - Have all 10 agents brainstorm through their domain lenses (Phase A - completed)\n   - After brainstorms complete, synthesize insights and assign concrete Phase B deliverables\n   - Launch agents to execute Phase B and produce deliverables (specs, wireframes, HTML mockups)\n   - Follow \"limitless code tokens strategy\" for compound, self-extending work\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Orchestrator Pattern**: Coordinating 10 specialized design agents via prompt.md files\n   - **Run Management**: Sequential numbered runs with manifest tracking (`runs/run-XXX--YYYY-MM-DD/`)\n   - **Two-Phase Workflow**: Phase A (parallel brainstorm) → Phase B (wave-based execution with dependencies)\n   - **Wave-Based Dependencies**: Wave 1 (foundation) → Wave 2 (flows) → Wave 3 (deliverables)\n   - **Background Subagent Execution**: Parallel Task tool calls with `run_in_background: true`\n   - **10 Agent Domains**: Paula Scher (Host Acquisition), Saul Bass (Landing/Hero), Massimo Vignelli (Search/Listings), Dieter Rams (Trust), Don Norman (Proposal Flows), Jony Ive (Mobile), Josef M-B (Design System), Charles Eames (Onboarding), Milton Glaser (Copy), Luke Wroblewski (Conversion)\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`runs/run-009--2026-02-03/synthesis.md`** (CREATED)\n     - Comprehensive synthesis of all 10 brainstorms\n     - Identified 6 P0 bugs (unanimous agreement), 7 P1 agreements, 10 missing components\n     - Trust score: 2/10, ~19 hours quick wins identified\n     - Phase B assignments with 3 waves and 28 deliverables\n   \n   - **`runs/run-009--2026-02-03/_manifest.md`** (UPDATED)\n     - Phase A marked complete (10/10)\n     - Phase B assignments added with wave structure\n     - Expected 28 deliverable files listed\n     - Quick wins checklist (10 items, ~19 hours)\n   \n   - **10 Agent `prompt.md` files** (ALL UPDATED with Phase B assignments):\n     - Milton Glaser: Copy Bug Fix Document (P0), Customer Voice Dictionary (P1)\n     - Dieter Rams: Trust Hygiene Checklist (P0), Verification Badge System (P2)\n     - Josef M-B: FormInput Component Spec (P1), Error State Tokens (P1)\n     - Charles Eames: \"What Is Split Lease?\" Modal, Empty State Library, Activation Moments\n     - Don Norman: Proposal State Machine, Counter-Proposal Interface, Days/Nights Spec\n     - Jony Ive: Touch Target Audit v2, Modal-to-Wizard Wireframes, Orientation Fix\n     - Saul Bass: 3 Hero Variants (HTML), Day Selector Animation Spec\n     - Paula Scher: P0 Bug Fix Spec, Host Acquisition Page, Value Prop Matrix\n     - Massimo Vignelli: Budget-First Filter Spec, Listing Card Component, Schedule Visibility\n     - Luke Wroblewski: A/B Test Specifications, Conversion Dashboard, Quick Win Checklist\n\n   - **10 Brainstorm files** (ALL READ for synthesis):\n     - Location: `runs/run-009--2026-02-03/brainstorm/`\n     - Key findings extracted: P0 bugs, \"Bid\"→\"Request\" rename, Days vs Nights confusion, Trust gaps, \"Ghost Roommate\" customer language\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **File Write Error**: Attempted to write Phase B prompts to 10 prompt.md files without reading them fully first\n     - Error: \"File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.\"\n     - Fix: Read all 10 prompt.md files fully (not just first 20 lines), then wrote new content successfully\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully synthesized 10 diverse brainstorm outputs into coherent cross-agent themes\n   - Identified unanimous P0 bugs and strong consensus items\n   - Created wave-based dependency structure for Phase B (Wave 1 foundation → Wave 2 flows → Wave 3 deliverables)\n   - Launched all 10 agents in parallel background mode for efficient execution\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"ok sinthesize and asssign concrete deliverables to each agent\" (before context compaction)\n   - \"next\" (to launch Phase B execution)\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - 10 background agents currently executing Phase B deliverables\n   - Expected outputs: 28 files in `runs/run-009--2026-02-03/deliverables/`\n   - Monitor agent completion and verify deliverables\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Launched all 10 Phase B agents in parallel background mode. Each agent is reading their brainstorm file and prompt.md, then producing their assigned deliverables. Agent IDs and status:\n   - Milton Glaser (a93c73c): Running, ~33k tokens\n   - Dieter Rams (a5bea79): Running, ~37k tokens\n   - Josef M-B (ad34fc4): Running, ~31k tokens\n   - Charles Eames (a3a2c62): Running, ~38k tokens\n   - Don Norman (a020b77): Running, ~21k tokens\n   - Jony Ive (ac702b8): Running, ~21k tokens\n   - Saul Bass (a0c9a65): Running, ~21k tokens\n   - Paula Scher (af0f1b1): Running, ~21k tokens\n   - Massimo Vignelli (a39a9e5): Running, ~21k tokens\n   - Luke Wroblewski (a45cf96): Launched\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Wait for all 10 background agents to complete, then verify deliverables were created in `runs/run-009--2026-02-03/deliverables/`. User's last message was simply \"next\" indicating to proceed with Phase B execution, which is now running.\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\.claude\\projects\\c--Users-Split-Lease-Documents-Split-Lease\\e447cfea-0e77-4f42-a03d-2d8d6d7183c5.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.",
