  "complete": "Valid point. Let me be direct about what's actually happening:\n\n**The Real Issue:**\nThe database has column names with special characters (`Payment from guest?`, `Payment to Host?`, `Payment #`) that PostgREST/Supabase JS client cannot properly handle in `.eq()` and `.order()` operations.\n\n**My \"fix\" was a workaround** - moving filtering client-side hides the underlying problem rather than solving it.\n\n**Proper Solutions:**\n\n1. **Rename the database columns** (recommended) - Remove special characters:\n   - `Payment from guest?` → `payment_from_guest` or `is_guest_payment`\n   - `Payment to Host?` → `payment_to_host` or `is_host_payment`\n   - `Payment #` → `payment_number`\n\n2. **Use raw SQL via RPC** - Create a Postgres function that queries with proper quoting\n\n3. **Report to Supabase** - If the JS client should handle this but doesn't, that's a bug in their client\n\n**Which approach do you want to take?**\n\nThe column naming issue will continue to cause problems in other places if not addressed at the source. The `paymentrecords` table appears to have Bubble-style naming conventions that don't play well with PostgREST's query parser.\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: User wants bugs surfaced, not hidden with workarounds\n*Implementation*: Explained the root cause (special characters in column names) vs the client-side workaround\n*Next*: User to decide: rename columns, use raw SQL, or report to Supabase"
