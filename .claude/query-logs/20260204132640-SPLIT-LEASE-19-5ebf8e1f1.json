  "prompt": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   - User identifies as an \"agent orchestrator\" managing 10 AI design agents (named after famous designers)\n   - User wanted to test a new \"go get it\" approach where Playwright captures current site state before agents analyze\n   - Primary goal: Redesign the `/host-overview` page using all 10 agents in a new Run 010\n   - User then requested a centralized screenshot library maintained by orchestrator, organized by user journeys\n   - User corrected route accuracy issues by pointing to `routes.config.js` as source of truth\n   - User instructed to focus on middle-of-funnel (authenticated) pages only, leaving early funnel pages empty for now\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - Playwright MCP for browser automation and screenshot capture\n   - 10-agent design system: Paula Scher, Saul Bass, Massimo Vignelli, Don Norman, Dieter Rams, Jony Ive, Josef M-B, Charles Eames, Milton Glaser, Luke Wroblewski\n   - Run-based orchestration with phases: Phase 0 (Self-Capture), Phase A (Brainstorm), Phase B (Deliverables)\n   - Journey-based screenshot organization (guest-journeys, host-journeys, shared-journeys, mobile)\n   - Route registry pattern from `routes.config.js` as single source of truth\n   - Test credentials: Host `rodtesthost@test.com` / Guest `splitleasetesting@test.com` / Password `eCom@2024`\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `runs/run-010--2026-02-04/_manifest.md`\n     - Created for host-overview redesign run with 10 agent assignments\n     - Contains Phase 0 capture protocol, agent priorities, success criteria\n   \n   - `orchestrator/assets/screenshots/README.md`\n     - Library documentation explaining purpose, folder structure, naming conventions\n     - Updated with accurate routes from routes.config.js\n   \n   - `orchestrator/assets/screenshots/_capture-plan.md`\n     - Comprehensive capture specification with 130 total screenshots (65 desktop + 65 mobile)\n     - Key structure from routes.config.js:\n     ```\n     HOST PAGES (Auth Required)\n     ├── /host-overview           ← Host dashboard\n     ├── /self-listing            ← Create listing\n     ├── /listing-dashboard       ← Manage listing\n     ├── /host-proposals/:userId  ← Host proposals\n     ├── /host-leases             ← Host leases\n     └── /house-manual            ← House manual editor\n     \n     GUEST PAGES (Auth Required)\n     ├── /guest-proposals/:userId ← Guest proposals\n     ├── /guest-leases/:userId    ← Guest leases\n     ├── /messages                ← Messaging\n     └── /account-profile/:userId ← Profile settings\n     ```\n   \n   - `orchestrator/memory.md`\n     - Updated with Run 010 entry and Screenshot Library infrastructure entry\n     - Added pattern #9: \"Centralized Screenshot Library\"\n   \n   - `app/src/routes.config.js`\n     - Read for accurate route definitions (894 lines)\n     - Used to correct folder naming in capture plan\n\n   - Screenshots captured:\n     - `host-journeys/03-host-dashboard/01-host-overview-default.png`\n     - `host-journeys/03-host-dashboard/02-listing-dashboard.png`\n     - `host-journeys/04-host-proposals/01-host-proposals-list.png`\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Screenshot save ENOENT error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory` when saving to `host-journeys/03-host-dashboard/`\n     - Fixed by running `mkdir -p` to create the folder structure before saving screenshots\n   - **Incorrect route/folder names**: User pointed out capture plan had inaccurate names\n     - Fixed by reading `routes.config.js` and `split lease site exploded view.txt` and rewriting `_capture-plan.md` with accurate URLs\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Solved login flow via Playwright (navigate → click Sign In → fill form → click Log In)\n   - Solved screenshot organization by creating journey-based folder structure\n   - Solved route accuracy by using codebase routes.config.js as source of truth\n   - Currently executing middle-of-funnel captures starting with host authenticated pages\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"you are an agent orchestrador\" (initial context)\n   - \"read the context of each agent and memory and suggest improments for the neext runs\"\n   - \"by reading this... i few that maybe we should create a go get it aproach where the agents use playright to capture those images...\"\n   - \"ok can we do a test, i want to redesign the host-overview page you can acess it by login wiht this host - rodtesthost@test.com password: eCom@2024 the url is https://split.lease/host-overview suggest an aproach to use all agents, is it possible to test that on a another run\"\n   - \"sorry wrong site, teh currect site is split.lease not app.split lease\"\n   - \"where are the images stored\"\n   - \"love the results but it think its a job for you orchestrador to have it uptodate, create a plan where you create a folder with screenshots of the whole site, but organised in jrouneys\"\n   - \".\" (continue)\n   - \"I`m not confident sicen you are not writin the sames of the folders correctly, read this i think its more precise 'C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\My Drive (splitleaseteam@gmail.com)\\_Agent Context and Tools\\SL22\\Design\\2026\\Resources\\split lease site exploded view .txt' but its from month ago the code actulay is better source, but you can use that as a ``muleta``\"\n   - \"ok start working foget early funnels pages for now focus on middle of the funnel, where user is already log i, you can add the other to the structure i mean folder but leave them epty for now later we return to those\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete capturing host-leases page (currently loading)\n   - Capture guest-proposals page\n   - Capture guest-leases page\n   - Capture messages page\n   - Update capture log with all completed captures\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Executing middle-of-funnel screenshot captures. Just navigated to `/host-leases` page which is loading. The page shows \"Loading your leases...\" status. Successfully captured 3 screenshots so far:\n   - `/host-overview` (01-host-overview-default.png)\n   - `/listing-dashboard` (02-listing-dashboard.png)  \n   - `/host-proposals` (01-host-proposals-list.png)\n   \n   Todo list shows: Capture Host Dashboard journey [in_progress], Host Proposals [pending], Host Leases [pending], Guest Proposals [pending], Guest Leases [pending], Messages [pending]\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Wait for `/host-leases` page to load and capture screenshot to `host-journeys/05-host-leases/01-host-leases-list.png`, then continue with guest authenticated pages (guest-proposals, guest-leases, messages) using guest test credentials.\n   \n   User's exact instruction: \"ok start working foget early funnels pages for now focus on middle of the funnel, where user is already log i\"\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\.claude\\projects\\c--Users-Split-Lease-Documents-Split-Lease\\25ce023f-af51-4f9f-98ee-854be0e1bc28.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.",
