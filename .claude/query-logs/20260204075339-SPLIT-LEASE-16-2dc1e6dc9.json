Here's the current status:\n\n**Merge Conflict Resolution Complete**\n\n| Item | Status |\n|------|--------|\n| `.vitest-results.json` | ✅ Resolved - accepted HEAD version and regenerated |\n| Merge status | ✅ Complete - ready to commit |\n\n**Remaining Items:**\n\n1. **Modified file:** `app/.vitest-results.json` (regenerated with current test results)\n\n2. **Untracked directory:** `app/src/logic/bidding/calculators/__tests__/`\n\n3. **Test failures detected:** 9 failing tests in pricing list formatter showing `$NaN/night` - this is a separate issue unrelated to the merge conflict\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nYou can now commit the resolved merge:\n```bash\ngit add app/.vitest-results.json\ngit commit -m \"Resolve merge conflict in .vitest-results.json\"\n```\n\nOr if you want to stage the untracked tests directory as well:\n```bash\ngit add app/src/logic/bidding/calculators/__tests__/\ngit add app/.vitest-results.json\ngit commit -m \"Resolve merge conflict and add test files\"\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1.
