  "prompt": "do not compact, i think there are many things mentioned on this reposts that was already fixed, the usability tests where a couple of months ago and the customer calls years ago when we were validating the model, i few that the agents dont have a clear vision of the site how they can have that  just analisng the code base or runnning a comet validations",
  "summary": "Valid point. The source materials are stale:\n- **Usability tests**: August 2025 (6 months ago)\n- **Customer calls**: Years ago (business model validation era)\nMany issues identified may already be fixed. The agents produced deliverables based on historical problems, not current state.\n## Options to Ground Agents in Current Reality\n**Option 1: Codebase Audit**\nHave agents scan the actual codebase to verify which bugs still exist:\n- Search for the specific strings (\"I'm here around here\", \"2:0 pm\", etc.)\n- Check if the components mentioned have been updated\n- Validate against current implementations\n**Option 2: Live Site Crawl**\nUse Playwright to capture current UI state:\n- Screenshot key flows (onboarding, proposal, listing creation)\n- Extract actual copy from live pages\n- Compare against the \"bugs\" identified\n**Option 3: Quick Verification Pass**\nBefore implementing any deliverable, run a verification agent that:\n- Checks if the issue still exists in code/production\n- Marks items as \"VERIFIED STILL BROKEN\" or \"ALREADY FIXED\"\n- Produces a filtered action list\nWhich approach would you prefer? I can run a quick verification against the codebase now to see which of the 13 copy bugs from Milton's report still exist in the current code.\n---\n**Intention**: Address concern about outdated source materials informing agent deliverables\n**Implementation**: Identified the gap between historical research and current site state\n**Next**: Run verification against codebase or live site to filter actionable items from already-fixed issues",
