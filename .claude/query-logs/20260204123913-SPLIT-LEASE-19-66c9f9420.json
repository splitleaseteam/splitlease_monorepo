  "complete": "Excellent idea. This makes agents self-sufficient — they capture their own context before analysis. Let me design this:\n\n## Agent Self-Capture System with Playwright\n\n### Shared Login Flow\n\n```javascript\n// Login helper for all agents\nasync function loginAsHost(page) {\n  await page.goto('https://split.lease/login');\n  await page.fill('input[type=\"email\"]', 'rodtesthost@test.com');\n  await page.fill('input[type=\"password\"]', 'eCom@2024');\n  await page.click('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n  await page.waitForURL('**/host/**');\n}\n\nasync function loginAsGuest(page) {\n  await page.goto('https://split.lease/login');\n  await page.fill('input[type=\"email\"]', 'splitleasetesting@test.com');\n  await page.fill('input[type=\"password\"]', 'eCom@2024');\n  await page.click('button[type=\"submit\"]');\n  await page.waitForURL('**/guest/**');\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Agent-Specific Capture Tasks\n\n| Agent | Pages to Capture | Login Required | Screenshots |\n|-------|------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| **Paula Scher** | `/list-with-us`, `/host-guarantee`, Homepage hero | No | 3 public pages |\n| **Saul Bass** | Homepage, `/search` hero section, `/about` | No | 3 hero sections |\n| **Massimo Vignelli** | `/search`, `/search?filter=X`, Listing detail | No | 4 search views |\n| **Don Norman** | Proposal flow (guest), Host proposals inbox | **Guest + Host** | 6 flow screenshots |\n| **Dieter Rams** | Trust pages, testimonials sections, footer | No | 4 trust areas |\n| **Jony Ive** | All above at 375px mobile viewport | Mixed | 10+ mobile shots |\n| **Josef M-B** | Form fields, buttons, inputs across site | Mixed | 8 component shots |\n| **Charles Eames** | Empty states (no proposals, no favorites) | **Guest** | 5 empty states |\n| **Milton Glaser** | Error states, modals, notifications | Mixed | 6 UI copy areas |\n| **Luke Wroblewski** | Full funnels (registration, proposal, listing) | Mixed | 8 funnel steps |\n\n---\n\n### Phase 0: Self-Capture Protocol\n\nEach agent's prompt would include:\n\n```markdown\n## Phase 0: Capture Current State (MANDATORY)\n\nBefore any analysis, capture screenshots of your domain pages.\n\n### Your Capture List\n[Agent-specific pages listed]\n\n### Instructions\n1. Use Playwright via MCP to navigate to split.lease\n2. For authenticated pages, login with provided credentials\n3. Take full-page screenshots\n4. Save to: `runs/run-XXX/screenshots/[agent-name]/`\n\n### Credentials (Test Accounts)\n- Host View: rodtesthost@test.com / eCom@2024\n- Guest View: splitleasetesting@test.com / eCom@2024\n\n### After Capture\nReference these screenshots in your analysis. Do NOT recommend fixes for things you cannot verify are still broken.\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example: Paula Scher Capture Task\n\n```markdown\n## Paula Scher — Phase 0 Capture\n\n### Pages to Screenshot\n1. `https://split.lease/list-with-us` (full page)\n2. `https://split.lease/host-guarantee` (full page)\n3. `https://split.lease` (hero section only)\n4. Login as Host → `/host/dashboard` (authenticated)\n\n### Verification Checklist\nAfter capturing, verify:\n- [ ] Is \"Start New Listing\" CTA still broken? (Run 003 P0 bug)\n- [ ] Is $1M guarantee visible on /list-with-us?\n- [ ] Is earnings calculator above or below fold?\n\n### Output\nSave screenshots to: `runs/run-010/screenshots/paula-scher/`\n- `list-with-us-fullpage.png`\n- `host-guarantee-fullpage.png`\n- `homepage-hero.png`\n- `host-dashboard-authenticated.png`\n```\n\n---\n\n### Playwright Capture Script Template\n\nI can create a reusable capture script for the orchestrator:\n\n```javascript\n// agents/orchestrator/capture-current-state.js\n\nconst captures = {\n  'paula-scher': {\n    public: [\n      { url: 'https://split.lease/list-with-us', name: 'list-with-us' },\n      { url: 'https://split.lease/host-guarantee', name: 'host-guarantee' },\n      { url: 'https://split.lease', name: 'homepage', selector: 'section.hero' }\n    ],\n    authenticated: {\n      role: 'host',\n      pages: [\n        { url: '/host/dashboard', name: 'host-dashboard' }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  'don-norman': {\n    authenticated: {\n      role: 'guest',\n      pages: [\n        { url: '/guest/proposals', name: 'proposals-inbox' },\n        { url: '/search', name: 'search-before-proposal' }\n        // Then navigate through proposal flow...\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  // ... all 10 agents\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n### Benefits of This Approach\n\n| Benefit | Impact |\n|---------|--------|\n| **No human bottleneck** | Agents capture their own context |\n| **Fresh every run** | Always see current site state |\n| **Verifiable recommendations** | \"I saw X is still broken in my screenshot\" |\n| **Reduced false positives** | Can't recommend fixing shipped bugs |\n| **Audit trail** | Screenshots saved per run for reference |\n\n---\n\n### Should I:\n\n1. **Create the full capture configuration** for all 10 agents with specific pages?\n2. **Write updated prompt templates** with Phase 0 instructions?\n3. **Test the Playwright flow now** by capturing a few pages to verify it works?\n\nLet me know which direction, and I'll build it out.\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Design self-capture system for agents\n*Implementation*: Created Playwright-based capture protocol with test credentials for all 10 agents\n*Next*: Awaiting direction — create full config, update prompts, or test capture flow"
