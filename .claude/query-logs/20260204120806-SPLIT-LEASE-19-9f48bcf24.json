We've managed to get our hands on the internal playbook from a company called Splitlease, and we're going to walk through exactly how they engineer that feeling of quality.\n0:12:55 You've totally felt this, right? You download two apps, they basically do the same thing, but one of them just feels right.\n0:13:02 It's smooth. It's professional. You trust it. The other one feels clunky, maybe a little sketchy. So what is the actual difference?\n0:13:10 Well, it's definitely not an accident. That feeling of quality isn't magic. It's engineered. It's the result of thousands of tiny decisions.\n0:13:18 They're not always big, flashing red lights.\n0:13:29 They can be anything from tiny, embarrassing typos to really deep flaws in how the product even talks to its users.\n0:13:35 I mean, just look at this. It's so small, but it's so damaging. This was on their welcome screen. A brand-new user's very first impression is a typo that doesn't make any sense.\n0:13:40 Right away, it just signals a lack of care, a lack of professionalism. It's like a tiny crack in the foundation of trust before you've even gotten started.\n0:13:44 And here's another one, this time in the photo upload instructions. The original text is just gibberish. If you're the user, how are you supposed to know what file types are okay?\n0:13:49 This isn't just sloppy. It creates real friction. It physically stops someone from doing what they need to do all because of a simple copier.\n0:13:53 But you know, fixing typos? That's the easy part. The real real friction. The original. A lack of professionalism. It's the same old thing that And here's another one.\n0:14:06 This time in the photo upload instructions. The original text is just gibberish. If you're the user, how are you supposed to know what file types are okay?\n0:14:15 This isn't just sloppy. It creates real friction. It physically stops someone from doing what they need to do all because of a simple copier.\n0:14:21 But you know, That's How many nights is that? Let's see. Saturday night, Sunday night, Monday night, Tuesday night. Okay, that's four nights.\n0:14:30 But the user is thinking about the five days they'll be there. And this, this is where everything started to fall apart.\n0:14:37 So this brings us to a really crucial concept. I'm. Mental model mismatch. Split lease was pricing its apartments per night, you know, like a hotel.\n0:14:46 But their users who were thinking about a longer stay were counting the number of days they needed to be in town.\n0:14:52 This one little mismatch was causing confusion at pretty much every step of the booking process. So once you find that mismatch, the solution is to start speaking the user's language.\n0:15:02 Egg four days selected. They switch to language now speaking the user's language own goals and financial stakes. And look, the biggest group.\n0:15:10 A whopping six days. 60% of their Murray residents host. This is basically just someone trying to make some extra cash from their own apartment while they're out of town.\n0:15:17 And for that main group, it's not just about the money, it's about Ehm, Testando, Testando, Testando, Testando, Testando, Testando. Perfect.\n0:20:41 Where It's unbelievable. Hey, er. Hey, er. er. Um, I don't think that I can share a computer with you unless you log into one of mine.\n0:22:24 Yeah, but uh. So. Yep. Yep. You can share your screen or something. Um. Yeah, but I can sit in front of one.\n0:22:36 And you can control it through Chrome of desktop. Oh, great. Yeah. Uh, I have three computers that I can use SL2, SL21, and SL918.\n0:22:49 I'm gonna hook you up with SL11 here. I'll see ya Oh, here, it's, uh, ready for you.\n0:24:25 Great. I'm here. Okay. So, uh, the goal is to create a long running process. And, um, I think it would be nice to, to sort of just get on the same page on, what inputs could be, what the process could be.\n0:24:55 Um, and then, I kinda wanna do everything twice. Because I think doing it twice yields greater conceptual clarity.\n0:25:08 That is to say that, If we just abstractly go through one thing, we don't really understand the big picture even as we're going one by one.\n0:25:20 So I should. I wanna just go through everything twice. And tie it in to how this creates a competitive advantage for SplitLease.\n0:25:31 And how it creates a competitive advantage for you. Personally. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Uh, and I'm not going to interrupt you.\n0:25:40 Go ahead. That's okay. Uh, we're doing long running processes. Um, this is one great, way to avoid babysitting and get more machine leverage.\n0:25:57 And we're just talking about the inputs right now. Things that could go into it. Yeah. Inputs. So, a prompt is an input.\n0:26:11 Okay. The different AI models are inputs. The AI harness is an input. Okay. What do I mean by AI harness?\n0:26:29 Do you know? Uh, Okay, so, for example, you can use a blog inside anti-gravity.\n0:26:45 So for example, if I open anti-gravity and not even here, if I go to the agent manager, I'm not using cloud code at all.\n0:26:55 Okay. I'm going to use Opus 4.5. This agent manager is a harness. Yes. It is the thing that's controlling the model, okay, so we have models and we have harnesses.\n0:27:18 We have prompts. Okay. Okay. We also may have, uh, interfaces. Okay, so what's an interface?\n0:27:35 The interface might be, uh, Lewis, the mouse, that's right. We have clogged bot. You see, we have different ways of interacting with it.\n0:27:50 it. Yeah. And then I would say that the screen is an interface. I actually find it much more appealing to break it down in this way.\n0:28:08 Because it becomes much easier to be creative about the creation of the process. Okay. So, what else do we have?\n0:28:21 We have, um, video, files. We have, uh, you are out and download it. These are different and sometimes some work better than others for certain harnesses.\n0:28:43 So let's break them up. And I'll just call this video links. They are similar but they are still different as well.\n0:29:02 Okay. Of the video links, what kinds of video links do we have? Yeah, we have for working sessions and for usability tests, vision meetings.\n0:29:19 Okay, so we have usability tests. Oops, just a sec. Vision team meetings. Not all work or individual work sessions.\n0:29:48 Team meetings. Okay, so we have video links, and we also have video files. Okay. Okay. Um, we also have other kinds of video links.\n0:30:04 Um, and when I say we, I don't mean only split lease has access to them. Okay. What other kinds of video links are there?\n0:30:17 Uh, YouTube videos, tutorials, and terms. Yeah. YouTube videos, uh, on. Look, and this list goes on and on, right?\n0:30:36 I mean, it's actually quite a big list. So skills. Ideas, uhh, customer, stuff.\n0:30:50 Okay. So those are video links. There's actually quite a lot of video links with quite a lot of different kinds of information.\n0:31:00 Some of the video links also come with, uh, transcript. I find URL video links if used correctly. are easier to deal with.\n0:31:21 That file links. Yeah, for sure. Do you find that as well? Yeah, I agree. Yeah, you can use them, It's faster to use multiple computers and use them in the local machine and, but you just have to download them.\n0:31:35 Yeah. Yeah, totally. Okay. But we have more stuff as inputs. What else do we have? Uh, as inputs, uh, Yeah, we can use, um, bucks.\n0:32:05 And, Excellent. Excellent. We can use books. Did you hear me say that the other day? Yeah. Or did you sort of think of it yourself or?\n0:32:17 Yeah, I heard you saying that. Well, it's pretty great. I mean, here's my analogy for that. I just want to say.\n0:32:27 Look, if it's your co-worker, worker? Are you going to share like a book that's like a really good one about the topic that you imagine I tried to share all of Cold Start and from, uh, all of Cold Start problem with you just through voice.\n0:32:48 My voice. Yeah. First of all, I think it would be very annoying to you. First of all. Second of all, I don't think I could do a very good job.\n0:32:58 Right? I mean, like, come on, it's a book. Also, it's written by someone who's pretty good. And it took him probably a long time to write it.\n0:33:10 Anyway, so those books, books are great. And in this case, I'm just going to say PDFs. Uh, books, patents, research.\n0:33:35 I don't like to write, etc., because sometimes it doesn't do enough justice to the idea. Okay. Yeah, it's a little bit lazy.\n0:33:47 Yeah. Um, okay. So, they're, There's a lot of stuff we can vary. We can vary the AI models, AI harness interfaces.\n0:34:00 OK, one. One of the things that I want to talk about prompts is that prompts can actually have a lot of pieces.\n0:34:11 Okay. They can have where to look. They can have goals. They can have guardrails. So what not to do? And then I'm not going to write et cetera, but we should come back to that at some point.\n0:34:38 Now in the creation of where to look, uh, you can imagine that we have more inputs here that we can use.\n0:34:52 What's an input that Frederick uses every day? Um, he uses a comment and a blod prompt.\n0:35:09 Well that's not, that's an AI harness. Each of those is an AI harness, but it's an unlisted input, so we have a list here.\n0:35:21 And then there's still more stuff that we can list. What's another thing that we, uh, can add to this list?\n0:35:30 Uh, it is the bubble, um, context? Yeah, so it's not just bubble context, it's bubble. And bubble has, it has the IDE.\n0:35:48 It has the preview. it has the live URL. Okay, all of those things are slightly different, but they all, uh, come from bubble.\n0:36:04 What's something similar to bubble that's also an input? A potential input? I'm not saying you have to use all of these inputs every time.\n0:36:13 I'm just saying what's another, uh, input from, um, place? Sigma. Sigma. Yeah. Side form. Another one. Sigma. Side form. Yeah, that's the thing that I was trying to, Okay.\n0:36:44 We also have more than that as inputs. Okay. I'm gonna split them up into kind of, uh, uh, little groups here so that we can conceptually distinguish between them.\n0:37:00 There's another kind of input. I know it's hard, uh, but just, you know, take a deep breath. We can take as long as we need to figure out what else we have.\n0:37:19 It's a thing I've used to give you. Uh, recommendations on what to do. I'll just tell you. Okay. It's Gmail.\n0:37:37 Or email. Okay. This was an input because it had predo typing. Uh, primary data.\n0:37:53 Primary data is where we don't tell a story. We look at the data. Okay. So, like, um, if I have a video of a lion, that is primary data.\n0:38:12 If I tell you a story about me seeing the lion, that is not primary data. Does that make sense with the difference between primary and non-primary is?\n0:38:25 Yeah. Because, yeah, when you see something, uh, with, uh, a filter of a narrative, it's not a primary data anymore.\n0:38:40 That's right. It's faster and easier to understand. So a lot of people sometimes want that. They want to, oh, just what are you telling me?\n0:38:52 Yeah. I just want to understand quickly. But sometimes the, when you're doing a scientific analysis, you want to suspend your judgment.\n0:39:02 Because if you jump to conclusions too soon, you, uh, risk not finding anything new. Okay, so a lot of inputs here.\n0:39:16 I used it for predotyping primary data, but I also used it as a policy. Gap analysis, on emails landed versus intended.\n0:39:36 Remember I had Claude Webb look up all of the different emails that we've ever said. And then I had it look at a Gmail account that had different users and say which emails have we talked about before that we didn't build and so I did a gap analysis on emails.\n0:40:03 And then you and I work together to decide which ones we wanted to design. You remember that, yeah? Yeah, remember that.\n0:40:12 Yeah. Alright. So this is cool. All we've done is we've just talked about the things that could go into it.\n0:40:21 Okay, I actually think that there's more inputs. For example. There are inputs that could be outputs from other other things.\n0:40:34 So for example, there could be a URL map from current sites. Two, uh, bubble site. Uh, do you know what I mean when I say map?\n0:40:50 Yeah, I know. I mean like the mathematical version of map, which is, this goes to this. Uhm. Uh, okay.\n0:41:02 So there's a URL map. There's also this other thing like, ah, acages, Our site uses, Yeah. Uhm.\n0:41:22 And more. Hot jars and, Summary information. Oh, nice. Hot jars. Very good. Okay. Dude. How easy is it going to be to just brainstorm one combination per day?\n0:41:54 I actually think it's going to be pretty easy because we have a lot of choices here, okay? And so, I think we're actually drowning in the overwhelm of the decision of which inputs to include with which models, and we're worried that the next day it's not going to be actionable enough.\n0:42:21 Okay. I actually think that the reason not to worry about that is because sometimes, uh, Sometimes when you run an analysis, you don't know how useful it's going to be.\n0:42:39 I mean, imagine you just know everything all the time. Like, it's just not, it's just not realistic. So the question is, you know, can we create some combinations and then, um, run them and then glance at them to see how useful they were.\n0:42:58 And I think the answer is yes, because we have plenty of compute. I'm trying to 10x our compute from here.\n0:43:05 And I'm finding that the bottleneck is the long running processes themselves. themselves, and not the machines, and not the inputs, and not the, it's just the process itself.\n0:43:19 itself. So that's why I wanted to get here together with you today. It's only been 23 minutes, I guess, of us talking.\n0:43:29 And I already feel so much more confident about, uh, the creation of this stuff. So why don't we choose any combination of these things?\n0:43:41 Um, and I think what we should do is we should start by saying. is a process that you already built that has kind of AI writing.\n0:44:01 In design specs. Yeah. It's pretty cool. So let's start by, uh, taking an example. So this can be, why don't we, uh.\n0:44:19 We'll just do an example. Okay. So what did you use in order to create that? Yes. Um. Yeah, there are ten agents and different agents and they have context, different contexts.\n0:44:48 So they are specialized agents in some area of the site. Some of them are specialized in, uh, in this search page.\n0:44:58 Some of them are specialized in the listing page and host acquisition. And each of them have different, have a different view of things.\n0:45:07 Uh, I asked them to, to select 10 bucks. and they have like a summary on their memory so they can use that to make decisions okay great let me just start by, by doing this.\n0:45:24 Okay. So, but you used Clod, Opus for all of the running. Is that right? Yep. Okay. So you use Clod, Opus.\n0:45:37 And all I'm doing is I'm going So in their prompt, you gave them specialization. You used Clodopus. Each of them has some subset of books.\n0:46:01 Yeah. That created, uh, summary information. So this is the stuff where we were talking about, uh, outputs as inputs. So this is, outputs, inputs, section.\n0:46:33 Okay. And then you also told them to do something. You gave them a specialization. You used Clod, Opus. Um, you have a had them use summary information of, uh, different kinds of books.\n0:46:45 Um, what did you have them do? Yeah, the first thing that I asked was to take a look at the gold base site and suggest a list of things that they can do to, like, to find, uh, points of improvement.\n0:47:08 And, Okay. So I'm sorry. I just want to stop you. So you used an AI harness. Did you use comment for that?\n0:47:20 Or did you use playwright inside of cloud code? It was, no. How did you look at the site? Uh, it used the gold base.\n0:47:29 I used a cursor for, it was inside the split list folder. Uh-huh. you analyzed it by seeing the gold in the structure of the site.\n0:47:43 It only looked at code. It did not look at any pictures. No, exactly. It only looked at the gold. Okay.\n0:47:52 So for your AI harness, you used cursor. And, uh, you looked at, um, how put these inputs you looked at are just code of live sets.\n0:48:14 Yeah. And one of the agents suggested, uh, a checklist of validations, uh, of the, of one of the pages, of the pages.\n0:48:26 Uh, it was the proposal flow suggested a, a set of tests. and what I did was take this step-by-step-by-step test and provided it to comment.\n0:48:42 So, to do the test. Which is an output, step-by-step proposal, proposal test, which is an output, and then you had another AI harness.\n0:49:11 on it. Here's step-by-step test. Excellent. Excellent. So, that's, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, that's, that's excellent.\n0:49:30 So, let's talk about now, not just the inputs, but the points of manual labor. There will always be manual labor involved in these.\n0:49:48 At least choosing the inputs as a, at a minimum. but sometimes transferring information or sometimes answering a question.\n0:50:02 So, let's just talk a little bit about human, human setup. Oops. Okay, well, what'd you do? What'd you have to do manually?\n0:50:31 Yeah, dupe, uhh, I have to do minimally. Currently, what happens is, I have uhh, I'm not sure if there was- Right name for it is an orchestrator, but I have an agent that writes the prompts to each agent.\n0:50:49 Each agent have on its folder a prompt, M-E-D, file. Uh, yeah, and I talk only with this, uh, agent.\n0:51:02 And this agent creates the other- the other- the other prompts and run them. And- And yeah, I think if I have to say something about human labor, it's setting up.\n0:51:22 Uh-huh. This thing is- is setting up the- the- the- the structure of the folders. Uh, reviewing the- the- the outputs, reading the- the- the reports and- and seeing the- the HTML1, Okay, so I want to split that up into intermediate outputs.\n0:52:02 Okay. And then I want to set it- each step. So you, um, set up the structure of the folders. Why did you do that?\n0:52:14 So I don't get lost with the- with the inputs, with the outputs. Uh, I see. So each overnight process is a run.\n0:52:21 We have a folder for each overnight process, so it's uh- don't think that it's easy to- to find. Mm-hmm. Okay.\n0:52:51 There were intermediate outputs. Yeah. Did you have to make decisions about those intermediate outputs or change them? Yes. Yep. Yep.\n0:53:04 Is- I have to intentionally, uh, combine them. Ask the- For example, the guest releases pages yesterday, I created the variations and you suggested a Come back.\n0:53:22 The combination of- of tube. Of tube variations. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Have to decide which one I- I like the header of this element but the body could be this one and the day change would be like this, you know, this kind of decision.\n0:53:42 Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, I want to come back to this because I want to talk about, uh, goals. for a second.\n0:54:02 What do you think the goal on, um, runtime is? The goal runtime? Um.\n0:54:22 Yeah, the runtime. Yeah. Uh, at least four hours of work. Yeah. So, uh, like longer is better, uh, but over.\n0:54:42 Two hours means you can really step away. Okay. Um.\n0:54:56 What about, um, number of human touch points? Number of human touch, but ideally, uh, on the beginning.\n0:55:17 And just one in the beginning and just off. Okay. Ideally, uh, beginning and reviewing the end.\n0:55:34 Yeah. But that's also not, not reasonable. Okay. Uhm, I think that, uh, holding ourselves to that goal.\n0:55:47 Uh, we're so far away from that goal. That it creates a like a mental block on what could my long-running processes be.\n0:56:02 So, um, we want, uh, I'd sort of, I'd like to say it this way. No more than one per two hours.\n0:56:24 Yeah. Uh, but I think it's reasonable. Because if it's, uh. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, One thing that I noticed yesterday working with sub-agents is that in the beginning it will ask for validations for life.\n0:56:42 I mean, for the first five minutes. But, uh, once it's the sub-agents are working, you can, you can leave. Not something that's gonna start asking you all the time.\n0:56:58 Yes. Okay. So, um, now the next part. Interrupt. Or wait. What do you prefer? Do you prefer your agents wait on you or interrupt you?\n0:57:20 I prefer to interrupt me. Okay. I actually don't prefer that the agents interrupt you. Um, look, there's a difference between, um, sort of a soft notification.\n0:57:45 But if you had a place where you received a bunch of soft notifications, then you could scan that place to see where you need to go.\n0:58:00 But the idea here is like actually that you don't really want to get interrupted. Like you can't really do beautiful, clean, awesome design work.\n0:58:10 If someone's f****** interrupting you all the time. Or if agents are interrupting you all the time. And I think that right now what's happening is you don't have the ability to predict how long each agent cycle will be.\n0:58:30 And so you're kind of forced. to watch it. So soft notifications would be great. What else? Here. In terms of the goals.\n0:58:45 Okay, so let's talk about, um, ideas versus false positives. Okay.\n0:59:12 This is a trade off. This is a trade-off on how you make your agents. In a brainstorming session, what do you prefer?\n0:59:24 Do you prefer to focus on the generation of ideas or the elimination of false positives? Yeah, for sure. That's what I would do.\n0:59:41 That's what a brainstorming session is supposed to do. Is, instead of making it so, uh, serious, you have to make it less serious, you have Because you're not choosing to act upon every idea that's there, but you want to give them a chance to live so that you can decide if you can act upon them.\n1:00:08 So ideas versus elimination of false positives. Why, why is it easier to create, uh, long running agents that don't make actual code changes?\n1:00:25 Because it's, it's risk free. Uh, yeah. It's really, risk free to create ideas.\n1:00:39 Okay. So there's a different idea, uh, when we are creating long running processes versus we're creating, uh, very powerful human aided process.\n1:00:58 And when we're creating a very powerful human aided process, what we want is to consume the most number of tokens per second.\n1:01:09 So this is, uh, Total tokens used, not tokens per second. So let's just talk about tokens per second.\n1:01:30 Sometimes, if you use the same cloud account, and you wanna do a lot of stuff all at once, it slows you down, and it kinda wastes your time.\n1:01:45 Right. Um, and there's fixes for that. So you can use, like, my anti-gravity setup is a fix for that, because I'm using and lots of different accounts, all in the same project.\n1:02:00 Okay, so I just wanna say those are different goals. Tokens per second is the goal for when you're sitting in front of the computer, and you're doing dangerous iterative work, like refactoring.\n1:02:21 Tokens per second is really useful, because you can break the project into a lot of different parts, and you can have an agent be super specialized in its part.\n1:02:34 Look, you are just looking up information. You are just planning. You are just taking this phase and writing code. You are just taking the written code and you are executing on the code.\n1:02:49 You are just taking the executed code and you are running tests against it. Do you see what I'm saying? So, uhm, so you can be super precise, and you can break things up, and you can use a lot of tokens per second, to do something that's really hard.\n1:03:09 But that is not the goal here. It is not totally tokens per second. It is total tokens used. So because of that, what's an easy way to increase total tokens use?\n1:03:26 Uhm, uhm, uhh, I don't know, like, using, using the AI harnesses, like the, ehm, like, anti-gravity, and two of the different accounts.\n1:03:47 No, I don't know. See, I think the way you did it, it, is actually much more interesting. You just have, the way you did it is you just had different specializations, right?\n1:04:01 You had 10. Different perspectives do the exact same thing. So had you had one perspective, it would have been one times the tokens used, but you had 10 times that.\n1:04:14 So you had 10 times the tokens used. And it was very easy for you to just give it a different perspective.\n1:04:25 Yeah, so in this case, whether or not they worked in parallel or sequentially doesn't really matter. What matters is it was very easy for you to create more versions.\n1:04:39 Because, again, it wasn't about the 12- total number. It wasn't about the tokens per second. The parallelization is f****** awesome for tokens per second.\n1:04:50 But really you just increased total tokens used. Very simply, intuitively, by adding a specialization. Okay. You said, Hey, let's do, let's do 10 versions of this.\n1:05:04 Okay. Alright. Um. Okay. Uh. Let me tell you something I, I, that I noticed. Umm. this today on the overnight process of today I use it yeah the customer calls transcription and three usability tests, uh, report created by, by Comet.\n1:05:29 And I ask the agents to suggest, uh, to read all this, and suggest, uh, improvement.\n1:05:39 Some of them generated HTML mockups, uh, wireframes. And- but I, I know- Do you have the link to the wireframes?\n1:05:50 Uh, no, no. because I'm trying to imagine what you're saying okay go ahead but yeah the the the thing is it's suggested a lot of things that are not useful or that are fixes that were already fixed because I think the lack of of like the agents don't know exactly how the site is and yeah this is a thing\n1:06:20 like uh and I think- I think it's- it's a thing related to the things that you did- they just said about babysitting the agents and yeah I- I like, uh, my first dog was, oh I need to add more context so the agents know how is the current state of the site to not create this kind of like unnecessary kind\n1:06:47 of things but at the same time we let you state about the brainstorming without- without removing the false positives. Uh, yeah I just want to say that that's a thing that happened yesterday.\n1:07:04 Yeah, here's one approach that could be useful. You run the user usability test not as as more of a journey.\n1:07:18 Okay. And so you just say, extract the journey from this usability. And don't focus on the simulation pages. Just focus on the actual UI.\n1:07:32 Then you have comment go through our current journey trying to do the same thing and you record it in Loom.\n1:07:42 Okay. Now you have context as, uh, what our current website looks like. This is why I wanted Shorost to finish those glance spots a long time ago, is because I wanted a location where it was super obvious and easy to draw from.\n1:08:02 Uh, to know what our site looks like today and what it looked like yesterday. And I just thought, you know, pictures of every page would be fine for me.\n1:08:14 So then, um, what I'm saying is that, uh, we can improve the false positives by creating outputs that act as inputs.\n1:08:30 These things. things. And one of the things that we could create is, you know, our journey and our current current journey, uh, and then sort of, um, then ask it, what did, it, was there anything that people loved before that's missing now?\n1:08:58 You see what I'm saying? So instead of just having it look for whatever it wants, we would just give it something a little bit more specific.\n1:09:07 Yeah. Yeah. After you say that, it seems obvious. Yeah. The, the. So comment report was more based on describing the site and writing the books.\n1:09:20 But yeah, the journey is something. Thank you. A lot more useful. Yeah. Yeah. So we have the ability for us to create Loom, uh, of current site.\n1:09:40 Probably, you know, Loom plus comment. Yep. We need to investigate if comment can do a mobile journey. Yeah. Like can you open it up as mobile?\n1:09:58 Yeah, I see that. Yeah, problem before it. Yeah. So anyway, I, I actually think that this is, uh, in some sense, when we, when we do this like this, um, you know, I didn't want to do it because it can like make your head spin.\n1:10:23 Usually the right, my, my personal opinion on the right approach to start a project, is just to try it. Okay.\n1:10:34 So that you can intuitively just try stuff and learn and do whatever makes sense but then I think the right thing to do is to say, okay, well, what's the structure of this and how could we understand the structure and make it a lot easier.\n1:10:50 And that's the, I think that's where we're at right now is understanding the structure. Yeah. This, this. Yeah. This is a file which what I want to do with it is I just want to make a copy every day with this file where we select small pieces.\n1:11:14 and we make one more process and then instead of I don't know I feel like that's going to remove a ton of anxiety.\n1:11:26 Yeah. Uh, and by the way, look, if you can create a process literally that you run every day and, uh, you know, on day 10, you're doing 10 times as much.\n1:11:41 On day 20, you're doing 20 times as much. You know what I mean? It's like your, your, your speed of progress is unbelievable.\n1:11:51 And then you can kind of like tweak it. And the thing is that the outputs, they become inputs for new things, right?\n1:11:58 Because it's all just like passes and iterations and greater understanding and. new feature sets and stuff. Um, so, uh, what we need is, uh, to set up some sort of computer to give you that computer that you and I can use every day.\n1:12:19 That I have access to like this. Um, I don't think that split least 11 is the right one right now.\n1:12:27 Because I've been using it as like an anti gravity setup. But I have this other one, I have this other one, split least 22, that I'm going to move over to a screen.\n1:12:42 Next to me, I think like the physical environment space like changes how well we can do our work. I, I, you know, one of the things that I wish I could do for you guys is like actually give you a physical environment.\n1:12:57 I can only give you a, uh, I can only give you a digital environment. Yeah. So anyway, I'm going to move this.\n1:13:07 Exactly. So I'm going to move this machine, uh, to a place. And then what I want to do is I want to create a process with you.\n1:13:19 I don't know if we have the time or the energy. To finish it right now. But maybe we'll, maybe you'll think of something that you kind of like want to do.\n1:13:30 I think that the books thing is kind of cool. Because the, the cool thing about the books is that they're pretty smart.\n1:13:41 And they have goals that we sometimes didn't think of. And sometimes just writing the goals is even hard. So we could use a book to find some goals to create prompts with the agents using the books as the goals.\n1:14:01 And then we'll just see what they do. So maybe they do something super interesting that was like actually said in a book.\n1:14:09 Like this book, um, maybe the book is, um, platform revolution. Okay, platform resolution has a really important chapter, chapter five.\n1:14:22 And it used to be in our training program. And like, the thing about being human is that like your memory is not perfect.\n1:14:30 And so you probably can't remember what's in chapter five. of the platform revolution and that's really not a problem because we have a situation here where we are trying not to use our brains to store all the memory.\n1:14:46 We're trying to use our brains to do more interesting stuff. And we're just going to use the computers to store the memory.\n1:14:52 So later today, I want to use this uh, computer that I set up for you. We'll use it together. We'll set up an agent, our set of agents using this framework and we'll connect it to some books.\n1:15:08 Um, and what will change every day. about this particular process is we'll just change which book it draws from. I see.\n1:15:23 I wish that. And so that's what I mean by we'll just change the inputs every day. Um, because the human labor component of it needs to be pretty low.\n1:15:39 And I think it is really nice to have Claudebot. To, like, look, if you really, really, really care about the project and you really like need to get it done.\n1:15:51 To have the capacity to actually speak into your phone and have something continue that's like really important to you To literally have 20 of those things continue to be, you know what I mean?\n1:16:04 Because they all need human intervention to, you know, four hours deep, but it's an eight-hour cycle, and you would prefer to get all eight hours of it and it'll only cost you five to ten minutes.\n1:16:15 I mean, that's a, you know, that's a win. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty exciting. Like, if you, you are willing to see the results, this is something that's happening with me like a what, wanna see what are the outputs.\n1:16:28 Um. Yeah. Um. Yeah. Um. I like the idea of the box and I really like the idea of the journey using the ability to test for capturing the journey and then creating, Like, making comments replicate the journey on the current site.\n1:16:50 Yeah. I like that. Cool. So that's what we'll take out of this session is those two ideas. This framework. And just a renewed, uh, feeling of, like, yeah, we know how to, we know how to do this and we'll just do it.\n1:17:10 And we don't need to like rush around with our head. heads cut off because we only did that to gain access to the information.\n1:17:19 We don't need to to sit there and be busy every day. We can talk about this visionary stuff. Okay. Yeah.\n1:17:28 I will, um, yeah, for the next 30, 30 minutes. Let me find here the computer. I think it's SL2. I will start doing this thing that you said about the, the journey.\n1:17:42 I can make, uh, the loom recording and, you know, I can use that for something later. Okay. I love it.\n1:17:51 Yep. Right, it's been fun. It's been fun and I I'm hungry, so I'm gonna have some lunch All right, talk to you later, bye Bye.\n1:18:02 Bye.",

  "complete": "I've read through the conversation with Igor. Here are the key takeaways:\n\n## Framework: Long-Running Process Inputs\n\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **AI Models** | Claude Opus |\n| **AI Harnesses** | Cursor, Claude Code, Comet, Agent Manager |\n| **Interfaces** | Claude Bot, screen, mobile |\n| **Video Links** | Usability tests, vision meetings, YouTube tutorials |\n| **Books/PDFs** | Platform Revolution, patents, research |\n| **Primary Data** | Gmail, Hot Jar, journey recordings |\n| **Code Sources** | Bubble, Supabase, Figma, live URLs |\n| **Outputs→Inputs** | URL maps, summaries, agent reports |\n\n## Goals for Overnight Processes\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Runtime | 2-4+ hours (step away) |\n| Human touchpoints | ≤1 per 2 hours |\n| Notifications | Soft (not interrupting) |\n| Focus | Ideas over false-positive elimination |\n| Optimization | **Total tokens used** (not tokens/second) |\n\n## Problem Igor Identified\nAgents suggested fixes for already-fixed issues because they lack current site context.\n\n## Igor's Solution\n1. Extract **journeys** from usability tests (not just page descriptions)\n2. Have Comet **replicate the journey** on current site → record as Loom\n3. Use journey recording as context for agents\n4. Ask: \"What did users love before that's missing now?\"\n\n## Two Action Items\n1. **Books as goals** — Feed book chapters (e.g., Platform Revolution Ch.5) to agents, change book daily\n2. **Journey recordings** — Create Loom of current site journeys via Comet\n\nWhat would you like me to do with this? Options:\n- Update the orchestrator agent.md with these insights?\n- Create a new process template incorporating journey-based context?\n- Set up the books-as-goals workflow?\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Understand Igor strategy session\n*Implementation*: Extracted framework for long-running processes, goals, and action items\n*Next*: Awaiting direction on how to apply these insights"
