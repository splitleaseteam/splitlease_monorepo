  "prompt": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user established me as the **Orchestrator Agent** for Split Lease's AI Design Team (10 agents). The user requested:\n   - Create a new overnight run (Run 009) to analyze usability tests + 68 customer call transcripts\n   - Have all 10 agents brainstorm through their domain lenses, reading their memory.md first to avoid repetition\n   - Follow the \"limitless code tokens strategy\" for compound, self-extending work\n   - After brainstorming completes, synthesize all insights and assign concrete Phase B deliverables (reports, HTML wireframes, fixes)\n   - Let agents think freely and produce varied outputs\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - **Orchestrator Pattern**: Coordinating 10 specialized design agents via prompt.md files\n   - **Run Management**: Sequential numbered runs with manifest tracking (`runs/run-XXX--YYYY-MM-DD/`)\n   - **Two-Phase Workflow**: Phase A (parallel brainstorm) → Phase B (sequential execution with dependencies)\n   - **Memory Check Pattern**: Agents read their memory.md to avoid repeating past work\n   - **Compound Actions**: Self-extending tasks with high token budgets (2M per agent)\n   - **Background Subagent Execution**: Parallel Task tool calls with `run_in_background: true`\n   - **Customer Voice Analysis**: Extracting user terminology and pain points from call transcripts\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - **`agents/orchestrator/agent.md`** - Defines orchestrator role, run management, prompt writing format\n   - **`agents/orchestrator/memory.md`** - Session log showing Run 006 in progress, updated with Run 009 entry\n   - **`runs/run-009--2026-02-03/_manifest.md`** - Created manifest tracking 10 agent assignments for Phase A\n   - **`usablity test/SPLIT LEASE - HOST SIDE MOBILE USABILITY TEST REPORT.md`** - Host onboarding flow (Amanda Stone, Aug 2025), 8+ bugs documented\n   - **`usablity test/SPLIT LEASE MOBILE APP - USABILITY TEST REPORT.md`** - Guest messaging/proposals flow, 6 issues identified\n   - **`limitless code tokens strategy.md`** - 20 compound request patterns, overnight usage tactics\n   \n   **10 Agent prompt.md files written** (all in `agents/[agent-name]/prompt.md`):\n   - Each contains: Task title, memory check instruction, source material paths, domain-specific questions, output location, 2M token budget\n   \n   **10 Brainstorm files created** (all in `runs/run-009--2026-02-03/brainstorm/`):\n   - `paula-scher-brainstorm.md` - P0 bugs: broken CTA, invalid email validation, template variables; Big Bets: Earnings First, Import from Airbnb\n   - `saul-bass-brainstorm.md` - Hero critique, \"Ghost Roommate\" customer language, Calculator-First Hero concept\n   - `massimo-vignelli-brainstorm.md` - Schedule pattern visibility, missing filters, card hierarchy improvements\n   - `dieter-rams-brainstorm.md` - Trust score 2/10, unverified testimonials/statistics, granular verification badges\n   - `don-norman-brainstorm.md` - \"Bid\" terminology confusion, Days vs Nights mismatch, Counter-proposal framework\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **File Write Error**: Attempted to write to 10 prompt.md files without reading them first\n     - Error: \"File has not been read yet. Read it first before writing to it.\"\n     - Fix: Read all 10 prompt.md files first, then wrote new content\n   - **Slack Webhook Error**: Webhook URL not configured\n     - Error: \"No webhook URL. Set TINYTASKAGENT env var or use --webhook\"\n     - Fix: Proceeded without Slack notification (non-critical)\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Successfully created Run 009 with proper folder structure\n   - Wrote customized prompts to all 10 agents with domain-specific brainstorm questions\n   - Launched all 10 agents in parallel using background Task tool\n   - Verified completion by checking brainstorm folder and reading sample file (Jony Ive's comprehensive analysis confirmed quality)\n   - Currently synthesizing brainstorm outputs to prepare Phase B assignments\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"you are orchestrador [paths to agent.md and memory.md] just confirm you undesntand and wait next promt\"\n   - \"create a new run for an overnight process make all the agent read it [usability test path] and [call transcripts path] and create a loop, use them as subagents, first to brainstom ideas on what they can do with this information, but being carefull to not be repetivive ask them to read their own memory to avoid that, after they break storm you make a descision and you devide the tasks following the [limitless code tokens strategy path] and make them do what you descided it can be report html wireframes etc, let them thiknn freely\"\n   - \"open each agent directory inside of a separate subagent and read and perform prompt.md\"\n   - \"status\" (first check)\n   - \"status\" (second check - all files complete)\n   - \"ok sinthesize and asssign concrete deliverables to each agent\"\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Read remaining 5 brainstorm files (Jony Ive, Josef M-B, Charles Eames, Milton Glaser, Luke Wroblewski)\n   - Create synthesis report identifying cross-agent themes and agreements\n   - Write Phase B prompts to all 10 agents with concrete deliverables\n   - Update manifest and orchestrator memory with Phase B assignments\n\n8. Current Work:\n   User requested: \"ok sinthesize and asssign concrete deliverables to each agent\"\n   \n   I was reading all 10 brainstorm files to synthesize insights. Read 5 of 10:\n   - Paula Scher ✅\n   - Saul Bass ✅\n   - Massimo Vignelli ✅\n   - Dieter Rams ✅\n   - Don Norman ✅\n   \n   Still need to read:\n   - Jony Ive (jony-ive-brainstorm.md)\n   - Josef M-B (josef-muller-brockmann-brainstorm.md)\n   - Charles Eames (charles-eames-brainstorm.md)\n   - Milton Glaser (milton-glaser-brainstorm.md)\n   - Luke Wroblewski (luke-wroblewski-brainstorm.md)\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Continue reading the remaining 5 brainstorm files, then create:\n   1. A synthesis report identifying key themes, P0 bugs, and cross-agent agreements\n   2. Phase B prompts with concrete deliverables for each agent based on their brainstorm outputs\n   \n   User's exact request: \"ok sinthesize and asssign concrete deliverables to each agent\"\n   \n   Key deliverables identified so far from brainstorms:\n   - **Paula**: Fix spec document, host acquisition page redesign wireframes\n   - **Saul**: Hero wireframes, day selector animation spec, A/B test documentation\n   - **Massimo**: Schedule pattern filter spec, updated card component, filter panel redesign\n   - **Dieter**: Trust hygiene checklist, verification badge specs, error state components\n   - **Don**: Proposal creation state machine, counter-proposal chat interface, budget-first wizard\n\nIf you need specific details from before compaction (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: C:\\Users\\Split Lease\\.claude\\projects\\c--Users-Split-Lease-Documents-Split-Lease\\e447cfea-0e77-4f42-a03d-2d8d6d7183c5.jsonl\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.",
