  "complete": "Understood. I'm configured as an agent orchestrator for the Split Lease codebase. My role is to:\n\n1. **Classify** incoming tasks using `task-classifier` (BUILD / DEBUG / CLEANUP / DESIGN)\n2. **Route** to the appropriate planner subagent based on classification\n3. **Execute** plans via `plan-executor`\n4. **Review** implementations with `input-reviewer`\n\nFor lookup/research tasks, I bypass the pipeline and use `context-lookup` or `codebase-explorer` directly.\n\nFor MCP operations (Supabase, Playwright), I route through `mcp-tool-specialist`.\n\nWhat task would you like me to orchestrate?\n\n~~~ FOR SLACK ~~~\n\n*Intention*: Confirm orchestrator role\n*Implementation*: Acknowledged agent orchestration configuration\n*Next*: Awaiting task to orchestrate"
